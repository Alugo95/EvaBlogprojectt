        <strong>Hedgehog's dilemma</strong> is a metaphor about the challenges
        of human intimacy, it is described as a situation where hedgehogs seek
        to get closer to eachother during the winter for warmth. However they
        must remain apart to avoid hurting eachother with their sharp spines.
        From the start of the series you can see how Shinji fits inside this box
        as he attempts to get closer to those around him but inevitably, yet
        <em>unintentionally</em> hurts them.
